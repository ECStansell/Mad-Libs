# Mad-Libs
School project to create a game of Mad Libs from scratch.

Project Prompt:

Output a title for the game.
Ask if the user would like to play a game.
Ask for the players name. Greet the player.
Ask the player to choose from TWO story ideas you have created.  Use an if statement here to separate the code for each choice.
Ask the player to input between 6 to 10 names/words/numbers to fill in spots for your story. Please do not go over 10 inputs because it can get very long to run/test the programs! 
Create a short story to go along with the gameplay, substituting their inputted words into the story. Each story should be different and ask for different inputs. Do not reuse the same inputs for each story please. Your stories should be at a minimum of 4 sentences. 
Ask if the user would like to play again (use a loop for this). Validate the user input as being y/n. If they input something that is NOT one of your options, ask the player to try again. 
Validate the user input for the story selection. If they input something that is NOT one of your options, ask the player to try again. 
Create a counter to record how many stories they have created. Display the counter before asking if they would like to play again. 
Spend time formatting your output so that it looks nice.
